## Synopsis

The Evolutionary spectrum inversion and analysis (Especia) package provides
C++ code for the inverse modelling and analysis of intergalactic and interstellar
absorption line regions in QSO spectra.

Includes the modelling and optimisation of the background continuum by a linear
combination of Legendre polynomials. Implements an accurate semi-analytic convolution
of the absorption term with the instrumental profile. Also includes IO for model
definition (plain text) and result (HTML) files.

The code is further explained in
[Quast et al. (2005)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20041601).
The provided example and test case uses an artificial spectrum synthesised on basis
of data described and analysed by
[Quast et al. (2002)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20020342).
