## General information

The Evolutionary spectrum inversion and analysis (Especia) file set provides
C++ code for the inverse modelling and analysis of intergalactic and interstellar
absorption line regions in QSO spectra.

Due to the use of evolution strategies with covariance matrix adaption, the inverse
modelling procedure is highly competitive and capable of calculating the optimal
spectral decomposition without requiring any particular initialisation.

The code is further explained in
[Quast et al. (2005)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20041601).
The provided example uses an artificial spectrum synthesised on basis of data
described and analysed by
[Quast et al. (2002)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20020342).
